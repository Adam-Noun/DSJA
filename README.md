Dual Synthetic Jet Actuator 

The proposed capstone project aims to design, fabricate, and experimentally test the performance of a dual 
synthetic jet actuators (SJAs) for flow control in a water tank. SJAs are innovative devices used for fluidic 
active flow control, with applications in aerospace and ground vehicles, electronic device cooling, jet 
vectoring, and mixing in fluid thermal systems. The project will focus on hands-on machining and 
manufacturing to create cost-effective dual SJAs with adjustable exit spacing.

Different configuration (vertical or hortizontal) to record if there is any variance that the DSJA would experience depending on the orientation of the device.
